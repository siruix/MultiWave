MultiWave
=========
This is the source code from my course project at the University of Houston. 
Course name is Multi-Dimentional Image Processing. 
The source code includes:
1. wavelet transform. The code implemented from scratch how to generate all wavelet space using two method. One is traditional transformation by defination. The other is circular convolution, which significantly increases efficiency. 
2. Compression and decompression using wavelet transform.
3. Also included a separate side project. The Gaussian Classifier.
